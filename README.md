A Discord bot that takes a mass, in either pounds or kilograms, and converts it into the number of chicken nuggets that weight is equal to. Other functionality includes finding total cost of a number of chicken nuggets, and finding how many pounds and kilograms a number of chicken nuggets would be equal to.
